# Creating a React Page using Figma wireframe

## The task is;

to take this single page and build it using React

- We would like to see a mobile menu kick in when the site is loaded with mobile-screen sizes
- When clicking "read more", a modal/popup should fire (using React hooks) (feel free to put any dummy content in)
  -- the modal should be dismissable without requiring any page-reloading
